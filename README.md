# Tiny-Shading-Language

TSL ( Tiny Shading Language ) is my own shading language designed for my offline renderer [**SORT**](http://sort-renderer.com/).

The goal of TSL is to provide shader programming ability to my open source ray tracer project. 
Though, it is specifically designed for my own renderer. 
This programming language can totally be used in any other CPU based ray tracing project.
