TSL ( Tiny Shading Language ) is my own shading language designed for my offline renderer [SORT](http://sort-renderer.com/).

The goal of TSL is to provide shader programming ability to open source ray tracer projects. 
Though, it is specifically designed for my own renderer. 
This programming language can totally be used in any other CPU based ray tracing project.

# Note

This is just the very beginning of my TSL project. I have absolutely no idea how far I can go for now.
